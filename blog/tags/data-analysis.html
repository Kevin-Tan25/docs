Whether you’ve held a previous internship in product management, competed in a product competition or have just stumbled upon product management, this article will give you insight on what technical product management entails.</p><p>Abhishek is currently a TPM at Amazon under the payments team where he is responsible for the consumer payment experience. His journey to becoming a TPM has been quite entrepreneurial, with him studying engineering in school and then starting up his own software solutions company in India running it for four and a half years before it got acquired. Prior to transitioning to TPM, Abhishek took a career break. It was then that he had realized his skills and passions align with product management.</p><p>On the other hand, Vishal’s journey to becoming a TPM was more linear. After completing his engineering and computer science degree, he went on to complete his MBA before joining the innovation team as a Business Analyst at an Indian company. He then moved to Singapore and worked a few years at big Fintech companies. He then transitioned to becoming a product owner, then to product management, and finally to becoming TPM at Amazon.</p><b> So how does TPM differ from regular PM? </b><p>In summary, being a TPM is still similar to regular PM work. TPMs still need to fully understand the business model and address the why of a product that needs to be built. However, because they usually have a technical background, they are also responsible for addressing how the product will be built. They will be working very closely with tech teams and will have involvement with the architectural decisions of the product.</p><p>Abhishek mentions that being a TPM also depends on the organization you are working for. In some organizations, the TPM’s are responsible for the company’s platform, where they are managing its roadmap and focusing on internal processes. When it is internal, this makes getting feedback for your work easier and faster, but creates a heightened sense of accountability, as the consumers of the product are other workers at your company.</p><b>Is there a barrier of entry for someone who doesn’t have a technical background?<!-- --> </b><p>Although Vishal holds an engineering degree, he has surprisingly never written code. Despite this, he has not faced much of a barrier, stating that: “It doesn’t really matter whether you have coded before or not, but you should really understand the details of it. You should be able to fluently talk with the engineering team, the architects, and the tech leads to understand the problem area and the problem statement.” In addition to having a solid understanding of technical processes, it is also important that TPM’s listen to what the tech leads are trying to share and recommend ideas and roadmaps with them.</p><b> What hard skills do you need to know for TPM? </b><p>If you are an aspiring TPM, it is essential for you to start playing with data. TPM’s work really closely with data and it is their responsibility to ensure that they always have a number associated with the decisions that they make. If you don’t have experience and don’t know where to start, you can start by picking up querying languages such as SQL and using data visualization tools such as Tableau to make sense of the data given to you. As Abhishek mentions: “If you can work really closely with the data that&#x27;s going to be really helpful. If you want to get to the next level you can even learn Python or R.” Aside from being fluent in data, understanding how software works and how different systems interact with one another is also integral. “It is really important that you are able to read through a high level design of a system, understand databases, and where the data can be stored,” says Vishal.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/product-management">product management</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/data-analysis">data analysis</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/roadmap">roadmap</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 UBC Product Management Club.
