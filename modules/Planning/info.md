### **Sessions:**

- **#1: Defining your Product Vision**
    
    1. What is a Product Vision? Addressing the What and Why
    
    - A product vision describes the overarching long-term mission of your product. Vision statements are aspirational and communicate concisely where the product hopes to go and what it hopes to achieve in the long term.
    
    2. Elements of Product Vision (Based on Product School):
    
    - Clear and inspiring product vision statement: share the “what” and “how” of your products. Ensure that they are aspirational, high-level, and provide direction.
        - Activity: choose a product that you are familiar with, and define their product vision based on your knowledge of the product.
    - Connection to customer needs and market reality: define what success looks like from the users' perspective, considering their challenges, problems, and goals. Align with the realities of the market, this includes competitions and trends.
    - Alignment with the Company’s Values and Goals: support and enhance the overall business strategy and resonate with the company’s mission and ethos.
    - Envisions Long-term Success and Scalability: sets the stage for future growth and evolution, envision how the product can scale, adapt, and remain relevant as it grows and as market conditions change.
    - Adaptability to Market Changes: allow for flexibility and adaptability in the face of changing market dynamics. It should be resilient enough to stay relevant in changing circumstances and agile enough to pivot when necessary
    
    3. Role of a PM in setting the Product Vision:
    
    Everyone has a role in setting the product vision,since it should influence how everyone throughout the company performs their job. As a PM, you should take the lead on creating and communicating it.
    
    - Collaborate with stakeholders: ensures a well-rounded perspective and encourages shared ownership of the vision across different teams.
    - Lead market and customer research: This includes identifying target customers, understanding their pain points and preferences, and staying updated on market trends and competition
    - Translate business strategy into product strategy: understand the overall business goals, such as market positioning and revenue targets, and then formulate a Product Strategy that aligns with these goals.
    - Communicate the vision to the team and the entire organization: this includes crafting a clear, compelling narrative that conveys the essence of the vision, and sharing it widely across the company.
    
    4. Activity: all this can be done by breaking it down in a product vision board (choose 1 of the options):
    
    - Choose a Company and Break Down Their Product Vision into the Product Vision Board
    - Fill in the Product Vision Board for a Product You Are Interested in Creating

- **#2: Product Strategies**
    
    1. What is a Product Strategy: Defining Your Desired Results
    
    A [product strategy](https://amplitude.com/glossary/terms/product-strategy) outlines the principles that justify the creation of the product and the work required to make it successful.The product strategy should bridge your product vision and the tactical steps to fulfill that mission. It helps companies answer these essential questions about their product:
    
    - Who is the customer base?
    - How will the product address these customers’ pain points?
        - What problems will our product solve
    - How will the product benefit the company?
    - How will our product differentiate itself and win the market?
    
    3. Product Strategy Models
    
    - Differentiation Strategy: This product strategy example works best for unique products compared to existing offerings on the market.
    - Quality strategy: create the best possible product in terms of reliability, capabilities, and experience. Your product is the premium option against competition.
    - Cost strategy: focuses on making a good yet inexpensive product. This works best when your new product can’t be differentiated from existing offerings.
    - Focus strategy: focuses on building a product to appeal to a hyper-specific market, develop features for a well-defined segment and a niche market.
    
    4. Some metrics to measure product strategy goals:
    
    - Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
    - Customer lifetime value (CLV)
    - Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
    - Monthly usage
    - Retention rate
    
    5. Final advice:
    
    - Periodically review the product vision and strategy. Ensure that the initiatives and priorities still support the winning product strategy you created in the start.

- **#3: Product Requirements Document**
    
    What is a PRD?
    
    A PRD is a guide that defines a particular product's requirements, including its purpose, features, functionality, and behavior. It is written by the PM to communicate:
    
    - What are they building?
    - Who is it for?
    - How does it benefit the end user?
    
    Why do we need a PRD?
    
    Product requirements documents also show how the product’s goals will be met with different aspects of the product. This document will be used to:
    
    - describe the product to stakeholders
    - help your sales team be able to pitch the product in a compelling way so that they can sell
    - help designers understand how the product is supposed to look and act (blueprint)
    
    5 Main Steps:
    
    1. Goals, Business Objectives, Strategic Fit
        1. Explain why you are building this and what you hope to accomplish.
    2. User stories:
        1. a short explanation as to why the feature is important, and how the user is going to benefit from the feature.
    3. User design and interactions: UX Flow and Design Notes
        1. describe the overall user workflow.’
    4. System and Environment Requirements
        1. Which end-user environments will be supported (browser/PC)
    5. Questions, clarifications, scope, assumptions, constraints
        1. User expectations, limits for implementation

    - Help communicate with external stakeholders, including customers
    
    **Best practices for a product roadmap:**
    
    - Only include as much detail as necessary for your audience
    - Keep the roadmap evenly focused on short-term tactics and how these relate to long-term goals
    - Review roadmaps on a regular basis and make adjustments when plans change
    - Stay connected with stakeholders at all levels to ensure alignment
    
    **What goes in a product roadmap?**
    
    - Generate goal(s) for a specific, narrow period of time
    - Identify the problems that can be solved
    - Align with your internal teams and stakeholders
    - Define metrics of success and KPIs for the initiatives in the product roadmap
    - Create priorities for the product roadmap
    
    **Presenting your product roadmap**
    
    Your roadmap presentation is the perfect time to shine as a product manager in front of your stakeholders:
    
    - Demonstrate how well you know the market, the users, the product, and the business goals.
    - Ask yourself:
        - What information does each department and stakeholder care about?
        - What will affect their work the most?

### Learning Objectives

**Lesson 1: Defining the product vision statement**

Before embarking on building the product, it is important to establish a product vision statement that encapsulates the long-term objective for the product's future. Rather than centering on the product's benefits for the company or yourself, redirect the attention towards the end user. Define what success looks like from the users' perspective, considering their challenges, problems, and goals. Strive for an ambitious vision that pushes boundaries while also ensuring its feasibility. One tool that can be helpful in defining your product vision statement is a product vision board. It allows you to break down your ideas into key components, including the vision, target group, needs, product, and business goals.

Potential Topics: 

- Painting the Big Picture: Workshop for Creating a Product Vision Board and Value Proposition
