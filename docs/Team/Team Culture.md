# Team Culture

<h1>We're People First.</h1>
PMC is a club of people. Breaking into product management—and helping others along the way—takes dedicated work and significant effort, but there is a human aspect that should not be forgotten.
<ul>
<li>When dealing with others, always assume positive intent from their actions. We all have a common goal, and can help one another.</li>
<li>When meeting, consider others’ health and well-being first. If they are consistently unproductive, there is likely a root cause that is far deeper.</li>
<li> Get to the point where you can call one another “friends,” not colleagues.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Passionate about Product.</h1>

The club’s leaders should be passionate about product management. Why:

- their passion will show in their work and rub off on others
- they will gain significantly more from the club than just someone interested in a single skill like marketing or website development
- as a result, they will invest significantly more in the club as they care about their activities and can benefit from them

If you want to be a product manager, act like a product manager in more of the things you do, including when working in PMC.
