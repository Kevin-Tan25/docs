# Team Culture

<h1>We're People First.</h1>
PMC is a club of people. Breaking into product management—and helping others along the way—takes dedicated work and significant effort, but there is a human aspect that should not be forgotten.

When dealing with others, always assume positive intent from their actions. We all have a common goal, and can help one another.

When meeting, consider others’ health and well-being first. If they are consistently unproductive, there is likely a root cause that is far deeper.

Get to the point where you can call one another “friends,” not colleagues.
