It intensely involved all functional areas of the club—events, industry partnerships, marketing, design, website dev, and developed new areas of research and curriculum development.</p><p>Aiming to bridge the gap between students and industry, Product Sprint tackled the “chicken and egg” problem of candidates unable to obtain a PM job without PM experience. Over two weeks, 24 teams of competitors explored a problem space provided by a PM of Hootsuite, EY, BuildDirect, or Kinzoo. After gathering inputs, defining the problem, and designing a solution, they pitched to the company and were awarded thousands of dollars in prizes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advisors">Advisors<a href="#advisors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advisors" title="Direct link to Advisors">​</a></h3><hr><p>Timothy Yeung and Steven Harbaruk, who spoke at the <a href="https://www.notion.so/PMC-History-89033a658a264f81a4441f5e5bc50794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discover PM 2021</a> event, joined the team as advisors.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeungtimothy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothy</a></strong> was President @ ProductBC &amp; Associate Director of Product Management @ EY.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharbaruk/?originalSubdomain=ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven</a></strong> was Lead PM @ Grammarly.</p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria<a href="#judging-criteria" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Judging Criteria" title="Direct link to Judging Criteria">​</a></h3><hr><p>Judging criteria were based on Produthon’s criteria—which we thought needed some improvement—and Marty Cagan’s “4 risks” of any product:</p><ul><li>User Value</li><li>Design Usability</li><li>Technical Feasibility</li><li>Business Viability</li></ul><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="curriculum-development">Curriculum Development<a href="#curriculum-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Curriculum Development" title="Direct link to Curriculum Development">​</a></h3><hr><p>The competition was split into four phases:</p><ul><li>Discovery</li><li>Solution</li><li>Construction</li><li>Presentation</li></ul><p>Each phase started with a workshop presentation, which taught participants the necessary skills for the respective sessions. Participants were given pre-workshop materials and had the chance to collaborate with their mentors for the workshop exercises. To keep track of participant progress, teams were also required to complete a mandatory check-in with their mentors through each phase.</p><p>Additional rewards were given to participants who actively show their learning on our Discord channel.</p><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="decisions-mentorship-cases">Decisions: mentorship, cases<a href="#decisions-mentorship-cases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Decisions: mentorship, cases" title="Direct link to Decisions: mentorship, cases">​</a></h3><hr><p><strong>Mentorship</strong></p><p>We had two main ideas for mentorship. First, we could copy Produthon, where there were drop-in “Mentor Office Hours.” Mentors were assigned time slots and participants could optionally show up to each session. Our second option was to assign mentors to teams, which was more technically challenging and would require more mentors. Each team would be assigned to two mentors, who would support the participants throughout the course of the competition.</p><p>We eventually decided that assigning each team a mentor was a better idea. With a supporting mentor, participants felt more included and cared for–thus, more commitment. This also generated more value for both participants and mentors: participants would gain more tailored feedback on their ideas. Mentors gain more satisfaction by seeing the participants grow.</p><hr></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/UBC-Product-Management-Club/docs/tree/main/docs/Club History/Founding and Resources.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/Execs"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Execs</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#summary" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Summary</a></li><li><a href="#-founding" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">🆕 Founding</a></li><li><a href="#️-speaker-series" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">🗣️ Speaker Series</a><ul><li><a href="#discover-pm" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Discover PM</a></li><li><a href="#intern-insights" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Intern Insights</a></li><li><a href="#resume-roast" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Resume Roast</a></li><li><a href="#behind-the-pm-interview" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Behind the PM Interview</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#️-workshop-series-for-produthon" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">🛠️ Workshop Series (for Produthon)</a><ul><li><a href="#exploring-the-problem-space" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Exploring the Problem Space</a></li><li><a href="#feature-prioritization-workshop" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Feature Prioritization Workshop</a></li><li><a href="#product-validation-workshop" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Product Validation Workshop</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#️-produthon" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">🖱️ Produthon</a></li><li><a href="#-discover-apm-summer-series" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">📺 Discover APM Summer Series</a><ul><li><a href="#discover-apm-google" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Discover APM: Google</a></li><li><a href="#discover-pm-microsoft" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Discover PM: Microsoft</a></li><li><a href="#discover-apm-salesforce" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Discover APM: Salesforce</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#-pmc-launch-2021" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">🚀 PMC Launch 2021</a><ul><li><a href="#discover-pm-v2" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Discover PM (v2)</a></li><li><a href="#pm-interview-prep-workshop" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">PM Interview Prep Workshop</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#-mentorship-program" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">💁 Mentorship Program</a></li><li><a href="#️-product-sprint" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">🏃‍♀️ Product Sprint</a><ul><li><a href="#advisors" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Advisors</a></li><li><a href="#judging-criteria" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Judging Criteria</a></li><li><a href="#curriculum-development" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Curriculum Development</a></li><li><a href="#decisions-mentorship-cases" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Decisions: mentorship, cases</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 UBC Product Management Club.
