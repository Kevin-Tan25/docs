# Fellowship Program

### Background

At the end of the 2021-22 school year, PMC hosted a “cohort” of 6 students who wanted to learn product management. Though several workshops were hosted, Scott found that his 90-minute “Product Design” session sparked many of the participant's interests. This motivated him to create a large-scale initiative to help the community learn, develop, and deploy their product management skills in a marketable way.

### Summary

Beginning in September 2022, a cohort of passionate students worked and learned together to prepare their portfolios for product internships where they were provided valuable mentorship from product managers! At the end of the term, they had the opportunity to showcase their creations at the PMC 2022 finale, which was held at UBC.
