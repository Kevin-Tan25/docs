Whether you\u2019ve held a previous internship in product management, competed in a product competition or have just stumbled upon product management, this article will give you insight on what technical product management entails.\\n\\nAbhishek is currently a TPM at Amazon under the payments team where he is responsible for the consumer payment experience. His journey to becoming a TPM has been quite entrepreneurial, with him studying engineering in school and then starting up his own software solutions company in India running it for four and a half years before it got acquired. Prior to transitioning to TPM, Abhishek took a career break. It was then that he had realized his skills and passions align with product management.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Vishal\u2019s journey to becoming a TPM was more linear. After completing his engineering and computer science degree, he went on to complete his MBA before joining the innovation team as a Business Analyst at an Indian company. He then moved to Singapore and worked a few years at big Fintech companies. He then transitioned to becoming a product owner, then to product management, and finally to becoming TPM at Amazon.\\n\\n<b> So how does TPM differ from regular PM? </b>\\n\\nIn summary, being a TPM is still similar to regular PM work. TPMs still need to fully understand the business model and address the why of a product that needs to be built. However, because they usually have a technical background, they are also responsible for addressing how the product will be built. They will be working very closely with tech teams and will have involvement with the architectural decisions of the product.\\n\\nAbhishek mentions that being a TPM also depends on the organization you are working for. In some organizations, the TPM\u2019s are responsible for the company\u2019s platform, where they are managing its roadmap and focusing on internal processes. When it is internal, this makes getting feedback for your work easier and faster, but creates a heightened sense of accountability, as the consumers of the product are other workers at your company.\\n\\n<b>\\n  Is there a barrier of entry for someone who doesn\u2019t have a technical\\n  background?{\\" \\"}\\n</b>\\n\\nAlthough Vishal holds an engineering degree, he has surprisingly never written code. Despite this, he has not faced much of a barrier, stating that: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter whether you have coded before or not, but you should really understand the details of it. You should be able to fluently talk with the engineering team, the architects, and the tech leads to understand the problem area and the problem statement.\u201d In addition to having a solid understanding of technical processes, it is also important that TPM\u2019s listen to what the tech leads are trying to share and recommend ideas and roadmaps with them.\\n\\n<b> What hard skills do you need to know for TPM? </b>\\n\\nIf you are an aspiring TPM, it is essential for you to start playing with data. TPM\u2019s work really closely with data and it is their responsibility to ensure that they always have a number associated with the decisions that they make. If you don\u2019t have experience and don\u2019t know where to start, you can start by picking up querying languages such as SQL and using data visualization tools such as Tableau to make sense of the data given to you. As Abhishek mentions: \u201cIf you can work really closely with the data that\'s going to be really helpful. If you want to get to the next level you can even learn Python or R.\u201d Aside from being fluent in data, understanding how software works and how different systems interact with one another is also integral. \u201cIt is really important that you are able to read through a high level design of a system, understand databases, and where the data can be stored,\u201d says Vishal.\\n\\nBlog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)."}]}')}}]);
