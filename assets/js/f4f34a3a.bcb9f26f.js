They will be working very closely with tech teams and will have involvement with the architectural decisions of the product."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Abhishek mentions that being a TPM also depends on the organization you are working for.

You should be able to fluently talk with the engineering team, the architects, and the tech leads to understand the problem area and the problem statement.\u201d In addition to having a solid understanding of technical processes, it is also important that TPM\u2019s listen to what the tech leads are trying to share and recommend ideas and roadmaps with them."),(0,o.kt)("b",null," What hard skills do you need to know for TPM?
