# Fellowship Program: Project Timeline

## **Case Projects**

As Samantha Wong shared in the Fellowship Kick-Off event,Â **you can't learn product managementÂ *solely*Â by reading books or watching videos**. These resources provide the theory behind PM, but to learn PM you need experience acting like a PM.

Over the next three months,Â **you will learn & apply PM skills by creating case study projects**. As you learn prioritization, you will try out the frameworks. As you learn about OKRs, you will set your own metrics. As you learn how to do user discovery, you will conduct interviews and iterate on your product idea.

This process of learning theoryâ€”from books, podcasts, videos, or articlesâ€”while applying it to projects will yield greater results than any typical product management course. As a huge bonus, you will be able to present what you created at the endâ€”and we'd be happy to share your work with the product managers we know!

## **Timeline**

**Phase 1:**Â Sep 18 â€“ Oct 1**Phase 2:**Â Oct 2 â€“ Oct 29**Phase 3:**Â Oct 30 â€“ Dec 8

On these Sundays (Sep 18, Oct 2, and Oct 30), there will be a Phase Kick-Off event to give you an overview of how to build an effective project during the following phase.

On Thursday evenings, there will be in-person sessions where you get to pitch what you've created so far with your project. You are expected to attend most of these.

## **Project Groups**

For phase 1, you will be in groups to help each other and receive mentorship. In phase 2 and 3, you will have the option to work on projectsÂ **together**.

You will be required to provide feedback on your group members' work. We encourage you to meet up with your groups and chat in Discord between sessions.

## **Project Scope**

The timeline sounds short, but the key is to define a narrow scope to your project. Focus onÂ *moving the needle*Â by considering a single user segment and how you can solve their problem.

**Define your time commitment up front and stick to it.**Â You could complete Phase 1 in three hours if you had to. In fact, the favourite product question could be answered in three minutes in an interview. The only thing we're adding is more time for research and wireframing.
